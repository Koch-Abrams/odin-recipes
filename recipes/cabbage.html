    <p>This is a recipe passed down from my great-grandmother, with a few shortcuts she approved of.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cabbage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>       
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook cabbage in boiling water until outer leaves pull away easily from the head, 3 to 5 minutes. Separate leaves and let cool. Reserve 1 1/2 cup cooking water.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in wet rice; cook and stir until moisture evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix beef, sausage, and egg together in a large bowl. Stir in cooled rice mixture.</li>
    </ol>
